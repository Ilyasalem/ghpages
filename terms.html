<div class='PageContent_title__2XB3H'>1. Introduction</div>
<div class='PageContent_text__18Q-w'>Welcome to <a href='index.htm'>exolix.com</a> These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) apply to any access to, or use of, any services made available using the website <a href='index.htm'>exolix.com</a>(“Site”), and to any other related services or materials provided by Exolix (collectively “Services”). By accessing or using any Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</div>
</div>
<div class='PageContent_item__1bzXn'>
<div class='PageContent_title__2XB3H'>2. You accept the risks of trading</div>
<div class='PageContent_text__18Q-w'>
<div class='PageContent_list__3nACa'>
<p>1. Trading or holding digital currency is inherently risky and the risk of loss can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding digital currency is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances.</p>
<p>2. The fact that a digital currency is available on the Site or in connection with the use of the Services is not to be construed as an express or implied representation of Exolix of any kind, including endorsement, warranty, approval, or disapproval of the value, integrity, security, or operation of that digital currency.</p>
<p>3. By using our services, you represent and warrant that you:</p>
<ul class='PageContent_list__3nACa'>
<li>Acknowledge and accept the risks associated with trading and holding digital currencies;</li>
<li>Acknowledge and accept that the price or value of digital currency is subject to extreme volatility. You therefore accept that there is an inherent risk that you may suffer losses as a result of your use of the Services to trade or hold digital currency;</li>
<li>Understand and accept the risks associated with trading and holding digital currencies, and are responsible for conducting (and have conducted) your own independent research and analysis of the risks specific to the digital currencies you want to trade or hold before using the Services;</li>
<li>Have the necessary technical and financial skills to research, review, and evaluate the security, integrity, and function of any digital currency made available by using the Services that you decide to buy or sell;</li>
<li>Acknowledge and accept that Exolix does not, and cannot, undertake any oversight function with respect to any digital currency that may be traded on the Site;</li>
<li>Have the requisite knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice, and information to make your own evaluation of merits and risks of any trade before using any of the Services;</li>
<li>Acknowledge that you may be defrauded when using digital currencies and accept that Exolix is not responsible for compensation or assistance to recover your losses in the event that fraud is committed against you by a third party, unless Exolix, including its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, is fraudulent or negligent in the supply of Services to you;</li>
<li>Have sufficient financial resources to make any trade before using any of the Services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class='PageContent_item__1bzXn'>
<div class='PageContent_title__2XB3H'>3. Your eligibility to use our Services</div>
<div class='PageContent_text__18Q-w'>
<div class='PageContent_list__3nACa'>
<p>1. Our Services are intended solely for users who are 18 years old or older and who satisfy the criteria described in these Terms.</p>
<p>2. Before you start working with the Site, you need to be sure that you meet two basic requirements:</p>
<ul class='PageContent_list__3nACa'>
<li>you are at least 18 years old and you are fully competent;</li>
<li>the funds which you plan to make an exchange through on the Site were obtained by you legally and within an acceptable jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Using our website is prohibited if prohibited by applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<div class='PageContent_title__2XB3H'>4. Deposits, Rates and Confirmations</div>
<div class='PageContent_text__18Q-w'>
<div class='PageContent_list__3nACa'>
<p>Using Exolix, you take personal responsibility for those financial losses that may be associated with a change of the cryptocurrency rate.</p>
<p>We guarantee the fixation of the rate for 60 minutes from the moment of creating the exchange. If you did not manage to send a deposit in the specified time, then you need to create a new exchange and send the deposit in the specified time. You can contact support if you sent a deposit on time, but the status of your exchange does not display this information.</p>
<p>Also, be careful and do not ignore additional payment identifiers. If they are ignored, the deposit can be canceled, and the funds will not be refundable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class='PageContent_item__1bzXn'>
<div class='PageContent_title__2XB3H' id='refund'>5. Refund Policy</div>
<div class='PageContent_text__18Q-w'>
<div class='PageContent_list__3nACa'>
<p>Exolix returns funds to the user if an exchange error has occurred and the exchange cannot be completed due to the incorrect Exolix system operation. In this case, the funds are returned in full and without commission. All cases that are associated with a client error require additional consideration by the support service. The decision on such situations is individual and not subject to dispute.</p>
<p>If an error occurred because of the client’s fault and he promptly informed us about it (before the funds were sent to the specified address), we will make a refund, but with a commission. If we did not receive the funds because of the client’s fault or we have sent the funds to an address that the client considers to be in error, the refund will not be issued.</p>
<p>For the correct identification of the assets, the user has to fill in the MEMO (tag, digital ID, note) field. Failure to comply with this condition or submitting the incorrect information may result to loss of assets.</p>
<p>If the user ignored the additional identificators (Memo, Destination Tag, digital ID, Payment ID, Message ), entered the wrong recipient address, sent the old tokens, or indicated the address of the wrong network, Exolix is not responsible for the fact that the funds will be lost.</p>
<p>Regardless the side of the transaction’s error, we never ask a client to go through the KYC process.</p>
<p>However, this rule applies only to exchange errors and does not apply to cases when the funds sent by the client to the deposit are recognized by the security system as suspicious.</p>
<p>If the funds that came to the deposit under your transaction were recognized by the system as suspicious, we may ask you for information to verify the source of the funds. If you refuse to provide such information, we are not responsible for ensuring the refund or completion of the exchange for this transaction.</p>
